Cableway AG is one of the main German cable network turnkey service companies, formed in 2007 by seven local cable network service technicians. Their service is carried out by approximately 1200 cable network specialists and more than 100 dispatchers. For the purpose of this project, Cableway main customer is Kabel Deutschland (KDG). Kabel Deutschland (KDG) operates cable networks in 13 German states and supplies its services to approximately 9.1 million connected TV households in Germany. Cableway acts as the Field Service Workforce for Kabel Deutschland. However, Cableway doesn’ t have technicians on their own, only dispatchers (responsible for booking the appointment(s) also) and management people. The responsability of Cableway starts when an order is received from Kabel Deutschland, and ends with a billing approval from Kabel Deutschland. To execute the orders, Cableway uses the workforce provided by their partners.<br />
